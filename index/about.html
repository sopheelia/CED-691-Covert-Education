    <p> We are a group of Clinical Mental Health Counseling students at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. As part of our Human Sexuality course, we were tasked with creating an innovative project that resulted in a potential product for community stakeholders. We decided to make a website to help educate individuals in the K-12 education system on topics of sexual health. Often in America, there is a severe lack of accurate and helpful sexual education. We wanted to have a website that existed solely for that purpose to fill the gaps that abstinence-based sexual education creates.</p>
