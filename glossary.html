  <h3><strong>Anatomy</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Clitoral hood</strong><br>
A small flap of skin formed by the inner labia that covers and protects the clitoris.</p>
<p><strong>Clitoridectomy</strong><br>
Removal of the external clitoris. See "genital mutilation."</p>
<p><strong>Clitoris</strong><br>
Sex organ whose only known purpose is sexual pleasure. The clitoris swells with blood during sexual excitement. The outer part of the clitoris is located at the top/front of the vulva, right next to urethra (hole you pee out of). The inner part of the clitoris, which is much larger, includes a shaft and two crura (roots or legs) of tissue that extend up to five inches into the body on both sides of the vagina to attach to the pubic bone.</p>
<p><strong>Fallopian tube</strong><br>
One of two narrow tubes that carry an egg from the ovary to the uterus during ovulation.</p>
<p><strong>Breasts</strong><br>
The two glands on the chest. Considered sex organs because they’re often sexually sensitive and may inspire sexual desire. Like mammary glands in other mammals, they produce milk during and after pregnancy.</p>
<p><strong>Foreskin</strong><br>
A tube of skin that covers and protects the glans (head) of the penis, and rolls back when the penis becomes erect. A circumcised penis has had the foreskin removed.
</p>
<p><strong>Frenulum</strong><br>
On the vulva, it’s the highly sensitive tissue where the inner labia join below the glans of the clitoris. On the penis, it’s the highly sensitive, triangular piece of skin just below the glans (head).
</p>
<p><strong>G spot (Gräfenberg spot)
</strong><br>
An area a few inches inside the vagina that can be highly sensitive to touch when you’re aroused. The G spot is along the front wall of the vagina. Touching the G spot can lead to sexual pleasure and orgasm for some people. Also called "anterior sponge" and “urethral sponge".</p>
<p><strong>Hymen</strong><br>
A thin, fleshy piece of tissue that stretches across part of the opening to the vagina. Not every AFAB person is born with this. </p>
<p><strong>Inner lips</strong><br>
The labia of the vulva that surround the clitoris and the openings to the urethra and vagina. Also called "labia minora."
</p>
<p><strong>Mammary glands
</strong><br>
Mammary glands are organs inside your breast/chest that can make breast milk, if you’ve recently given birth or had a miscarriage later in pregnancy. All people have mammary glands, but not everyone who has mammary glands makes breast milk.
</p>
<p><strong>Nipple</strong><br>
The dark tissue in the center of the areola of each breast in someone of any gender. Nipples can stand erect when stimulated by touch or cold. The nipples can also release milk in people who are breastfeeding.</p>
<p><strong>Ovaries</strong><br>
The 2 organs that store and release eggs. Ovaries also produce hormones, including estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone.</p>
<p><strong>Penis</strong><br>
A reproductive and sex organ that’s made of spongy tissue. The spongy tissue fills with blood during sexual excitement, a process known as erection (getting hard). Urine and semen pass through the penis.</p>
<p><strong>Scrotum</strong><br>
The sac of skin that holds and protects the testicles (balls). The scrotum is located behind and underneath the penis.</p>
<p><strong>Testicles</strong><br>
Two ball-like glands inside the scrotum that produce hormones, including testosterone. Each testicle also encloses several hundred small lobes, which contain the tiny, threadlike seminiferous tubules that produce sperm. Also called "testes."
</p>
<p><strong>Estrogen</strong><br>
A hormone made in the ovaries, and in much smaller amounts in the adrenal glands at the top of your kidneys, and sometimes even fat tissue. Estrogen plays a part in puberty, the menstrual cycle, and pregnancy. Many people take extra estrogen after menopause or as part of transgender care.</p>
<p><strong>Testosterone</strong><br>
A hormone produced in the testes and in smaller amounts in the ovaries. It’s important to bone health and sex drive, plus sperm production. Often taken as part of gender affirming care for trans men and other transmasculine people.</p>
<p><strong>​​Menopause</strong><br>
When menstruation stops because of hormonal changes. Usually happens between the ages of 45 and 55, but sometimes menopause happens earlier due to certain medical conditions.
</p>
<p><strong>Menses</strong><br>
The blood and discharge that comes out of the uterus and through the vagina during menstruation.</p>
<p><strong>Menstrual cycle</strong><br>
The time from the first day of one period to the first day of the next period. During the menstrual cycle, the lining of the uterus grows, an egg is released by the ovaries, and the uterine lining sheds.
</p>
<p><strong>Menstruation</strong><br>
The flow of blood, fluid, and tissue out of the uterus and through the vagina that usually lasts from 3 to 7 days. Often called a period.
</p>
<p><strong>Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD)</strong><br>
A severe form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) that causes depression and anxiety during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (after ovulation).</p>
<p><strong>Premenstrual syndrome (PMS)
</strong><br>
Emotional and physical symptoms that appear a few days before and during menstruation, including depression, fatigue, bloating, and irritability.</p>
<p><strong>Uncircumcised</strong><br>
When the foreskin hasn’t been removed from the penis.</p>
<p><strong>Urethra</strong><br>
A tube that empties the bladder and carries urine to the urethral opening (the hole you pee out of). The urethra also carries ejaculate and pre-ejaculate in people with penises.
</p>
<p><strong>Uterus</strong><br>
The pear-shaped, reproductive organ from which people menstruate and where a pregnancy develops. Also called “womb.”
</p>
<p><strong>Vagina</strong><br>
The stretchy passage that connects the vulva with the cervix and uterus. It’s where menstruation comes out of the body, a baby comes out of the body through childbirth, and/or one place sexual penetration (by a penis, finger, sex toy, etc.) can happen. During menstruation, it’s where tampons or menstrual cups are placed.</p>
<p><strong>Vaginal discharge
</strong><br>
Fluid that comes from your vagina and happens throughout your menstrual cycle. Normal discharge can be thick or thin, clear, white, or yellow when it dries on your underwear. It has a mild, not unpleasant smell.</p>
<p><strong>Vulva</strong><br>
The external sex organs that include the clitoris, labia (majora and minora), opening to the vagina (introitus), opening to the urethra, and two Bartholin’s glands.</p>
