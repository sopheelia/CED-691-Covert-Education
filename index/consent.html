  <h2 id="like">How to Ask for Things You Like</h2>
    <p> Communication is the best way to make sex a great experience! But remember that everyone experiences pleasure in different ways, so each partner may prefer different things that make them feel good. 
	Some people figure out what they want through masturbation and others through having sex with someone. 
	It is sometimes scary and awkward to talk about sex or the things you like with a partner. If it helps, you can ask them what feels good to them and what doesn’t and then tell them what you like and what you do not. (Planned Parenthood, 2023).
	Remember that it is important to tell your partner what you do not want and tell them about your boundaries.

<h2 id="consentp">Consent</h2>
  <p>Consent: <br> 
Noun: permission for something to happen or agreement to do something. <br>
Verb: give permission for something to happen <br>
Sexual Consent: is saying “yes” to sex or a sexual activity freely, informed, enthusiastically, and specific. Remember: Consent can always be taken back, once you say” yes”, you can change your mind and say “no”. <br> <br>
<strong> Being raped (forced to have sex without freely given consent) or sexually assaulted (doing something sexually without freely given consent)  is NEVER your fault. </strong>
