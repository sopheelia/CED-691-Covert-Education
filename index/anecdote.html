  <h3>About First Times <br>From Users on Reddit</h3>
  <p>“The first blow job I ever gave was an hour long. Why he didn't stop me sooner I don't know, I was a naive clueless virgin back then... Anyways, being on my knees for an hour long caused my legs to go completely numb and faceplant right into the wall.”</p>
  <p>“My boyfriend is in the Navy and I still live with my parents, so when he had a free weekend we took advantage of the situation and booked a hotel together for the night. He put about 1/4 of himself in and I felt like I was getting stabbed with a piece of wood down there. We spent almost the whole night trying to get it in. Every time he would insert himself a little more and he'd have to pull out because it hurt me so much.”</p>
  <p>""It took about seven attempts and 16 hours to get him fully inside me. We both felt bad when we left because we left the room a mess. Blood on the sheets, condom wrappers everywhere, etc. but we didn't think to bring cash for tip." - Redditor xmuhhree</p>
  <p>"My parents went out of town and asked me to come home from college to watch the house feed animals. I called my girl and asked her if she wanted to stay with me. We were in my bed, fooling around, when she turns over and says something to the effect of, 'I need to tell you something.' She tells me she had sex with someone from her dorms at school. I was furious and extremely sad at the same time. I don't think I had ever felt those kinds of emotions before, and it didn't help that we were both naked in my bed. We end up making out and having sex. It was over in about 30 seconds, and she runs to the bathroom and comes back crying, telling me how she feels dirty for doing it with two different guys in one week. The next day she texts me saying she doesn't want to date anymore." - Anonymous redditor</p>
  <p>"My first time, she moves to straddle me and knees me right in the testicles. It was over right then and there. I felt it for three days after. She was embarrassed for a while." - Redditor chigerfinger</p>
  <p>"It was so fast that there was no time for anything to go wrong." - anonymous Redditor</p>
  <p>"The first time for me was a little weird, is for everybody.

"For me, it was like 'OK...aaaaaand OH. Really? That's it? Well yeah that feels really good but... thats it? Well OK…'

I think your whole life you anticipate and fantasize about your first time... and then when you get there you realize the 'normalcy' of it all, and it can be awkward. Especially if you made such a huge deal about it in your head like I did beforehand.

It's just the difference between fantasy and realism." - Reddit user Brockvenom

<h3>About Consent TW: Sexual Violence<br>Stories from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/05/10/style/sexual-consent-college-campus.html">here</a> </h3>
  <p>“Younger me was taught the mechanics of sex but nothing about what consent should look like. In other words, I knew how to give oral sex, but not how to refuse performing it. Entering the dating and hookup scene with low self-esteem and little knowledge led to many encounters of an “icky” nature: I didn’t know how to stop them, once started, and often felt as if I was contractually obligated to take the guy to the end and expect nothing in return. So I did, even as I wished I didn’t have to.”
</p>
  <p>“After a couple of drinks at a party, I approached a guy in a fun patterned sweater. After exchanging small talk and dancing a bit, I started kissing him. He quickly asked me to go upstairs with him and I said no. He asked again and again. He told me I was a tease and if I wasn’t going to sleep with him, what was the point? I got embarrassed, and ended up following him to the basement, still saying I wasn’t comfortable with sex. But I felt like I owed him something.

When we got to the basement, I sat on the top of a washing machine and he took my clothes off. I soon realized I was alone; my friends upstairs couldn’t hear or find me. I was scared. I said nothing after the first few no’s, but after that, I put my clothes on, got up and went upstairs.

I’m lucky. A lot of people don’t have the option of walking out. It reminds me that consent is not sexy for some men; it’s a chore.""
</p>
  <p>“I didn’t kiss anyone in high school. I was determined that this would not be the case in college.

And so, courtesy of my concerned and more experienced male friends, I was armed with a whole new set of advice: “Don’t be a wuss.” “Girls want you to be assertive.” “You need to make the first move.”
</p>
  <p>“Early in our relationship when I brought up the subject of sex, she told me she had never done it before. I hadn’t either, but I lied and said that I had had non-penetrative sex with a high school girlfriend. I lied so she would think I was more experienced. I lied to her so she would sleep with me. She did, and our sexual relationship was marked from then on as being between an experienced person and an inexperienced person”.</p>
  <p>“He asked if he could kiss me, and I shook my head. I crossed my limits tonight and simply wanted to sleep. He asked again. “No.” He asked again.

Tired of it, I obliged. We kissed shortly, but I pulled away, feeling nauseated and unstable. He asked if he could touch me. I pushed his fingers away, curling into a ball, attempting to sleep. He asked again. I shook my head. He touched anyway. I was shocked by his incessantness, feeling stuck and confused — lying somewhere I didn’t want to be. I remember finally falling asleep at 4 a.m. after a constant battle of “please” and “no.”

There’s a difference between bodily cues of “yes” and the approval to touch, to kiss, to feel and to love.""

  <p>“On a September night, I woke up naked on a couch in a room I did not know. I was confused and throwing up into a wine glass. He walked in wearing a robe and sat down. I had to ask if we had sex, and he said yes. I had to ask if we used a condom, and he promised yes. All the stories I had heard of sexual assault were flooding my mind, and out of panic, I acted. I told myself: “This could not happen to me.” So we had sex again. This time I was conscious.

That next day I was googling “blackout sex” and “was I sexually assaulted” with shaking fingers. That same night he texted, “Also dinner this week,” asking to get together.

I asked to meet so I could fill the holes in my memory. He looked as if he were about to cry, or vomit, when I explained how little I remembered. We left it at that.

Within weeks, we ran into each other, and he drunkenly told me how he liked me. He asked to go on a real date.

We went on that date, did homework together each week, made plans, ate dinner in the dining hall, and looked at memes on that same couch I had woken up on several weeks earlier. One night he asked me to be his girlfriend; another night he told me he loved me. He even suggested meeting my parents.

If he liked me, it wasn’t sexual assault, right?

But suddenly he stopped answering and we never spoke again – as if nothing had happened.”
</p>
  <p>“I was so embarrassed. There I was: a little freshman, naked in a senior’s bed. Obviously I had to have led him on if he just assumed we were going to have sex! I could have gotten dressed and left — he wasn’t asking for an explanation, and frankly he wouldn’t have cared. He also would not have stopped me. But I was so ashamed to have put myself in that situation that I felt as if I had to go through with it. So I did.

It was physically painful in the moment and emotionally painful the following days and weeks. When it was over, I tried to pick up some of the pieces of my shattered pride and insisted that I spend the night (at least maybe he would want to cuddle, right?). I ended up sneaking out an hour after he fell asleep and never spoke to him again.”
</p>
  <p>“Here is what they ask: “Did you tell him no?”

Here is the truth: You can only say “no” so many times before whatever you say next is a lie.

Here is the crux of the issue: Whose job is it to know that?”
